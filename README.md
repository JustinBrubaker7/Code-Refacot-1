# Code-Refactor-1

The scope of this project was to fix bugs/errors in a preexisting code base. Consolidating and making necessary changes to follow accessibility guidelines by implementing semantic HTML and CSS. No major changes were made to the look of the website itself, the code was “cleaned” to improve SEO and help with screen readers.
